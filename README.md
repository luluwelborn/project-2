#### Proposal
Punny! Jokes to help alienate yourself.
(this title will probably change)

On the main app page, a random dad-joke will be pulled on every refresh from a database that I've created. That page will also have a 'get new joke' button that will populate a different random joke on the page. There will also be a page with a list of jokes pulled from a 3rd party API, so the user can browse multiple jokes at one time.

#### Captain's log
08.05.17
Getting started is one of the hardest parts(I hope). I've read through some of the mocha/chai lessons, and it seems very complicated. I've also spent a lot of time trying to get an ejs file show up and it's become tough. I'll try using a different GET method.

07.27.17
I really wanted to make an app to store my scores from different pinball games, and see the game's nation-wide high scores from a 3rd party database but I couldn't find a reliable source, so we're going with puns aka dad-jokes! I never remember jokes but I laugh at every pun-based joke I hear so I suppose this app is useful for people like me who are low on short-term memory storage.

#### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Node app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we'll give you the tools over the next couple weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

#### Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Have at _least_ 2 software unit tests** using Mocha and Chai
* **Interface** with a 3rd Party Web API of your choosing
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Utilize Mongo to create a database structure** and interact with your JSON-like data
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publicly-accessible **user stories you created**

---

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _to-do lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

#### Potential Project Ideas

##### Cheerups
The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other people's' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

##### Bookmarket
You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

##### Photo sharing app
Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners. Users will be able to view other user's' albums. Maybe users can comment on photos, or either up/down vote them.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

There are several requirements in the Project 2 rubric. Your instructors will score each of your requirements below using this scale:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!


* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Professional Development__: Did you demonstrates ability to communicate and collaborate with others in the classroom and/or on a team? Did you treat your peers, teammates, instructors with respect, make and follow agreements, and maintain a growth mindset?
